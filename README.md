Title: Using LendingClub data to form a predictive model

Subtitle: Create a Model to help LendingClub classify whether an applicant should be approved or rejected for a loan.

Problem to Solve: 

The problem that I am trying to solve is to create a model that would be used for classification of whether an application for a loan should be approved or whether it should be rejected.

Client value:

My client in this case would be LendingClub since I am using their data, but also any other Lender that would like to have a model that would quickly tell them whether they should give credit to an individual applicant. It would also take some of the guessing out of approving loans and help reduce the customers that default on their loans or false positives. 

Data to be used:

I will use the LendingClub data about loan applications it has rejected as well as the performance of loans that it issued. I have downloaded data starting from 2007 to 2016 for both declined and issued loans. The data also has a downloadable metadata description of the csv files that I will use to describe the variables. The link to the data set is provided below.

Outline of project:

I will first approach this problem by making sure that I have enough that to solve my question. I will then go through all the variables in the data and create a description for each of them which includes the type, what it means, and some descriptive statistics about the variables. Then I will write about the risks in using this data and how those risks can affect future models. Once the data goes through this, I will go through some Exploratory Data Analysis that will include using some visualization tools to look at the data from different perspectives visually. Once I look at the data them I will choose if we need to exclude some variables if there are some correlations, is insignificant, data is too inconsistent, etc. All decisions on model reduction will be outlined and evaluated for future evaluation. I will then use a supervised approach to split the data between train and test. I will then choose several models to run through the data and based on cross validation I will make my decision for the best model. At the end I will give my conclusion and recommendation for the best model to use and if we solved the problem we were seeking to solve. 

Deliverables:

The deliverables would be the model itself built on Python code. A report that indicated how I cleaned and transformed the data and any empirical evidence that indicates that the model is the best for this data, this includes some cross validation with other models that proves the best model for this project. The report will have an Appendix that will have all code used to come up with the results. I will also include a slide deck would present the model and explain in plain terms why this model is critical for LendingClub and how it would help them in their Lending business.
